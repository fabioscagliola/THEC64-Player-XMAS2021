A music player for the Commodore 64 including "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town" by J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie 

## Introduction 
Since 2019 I have been wishing happy winter holidays to my family and friends by sharing with them a video of my [THEC64](https://retrogames.biz/thec64) playing a winter holiday song 

## Development 

I developed the music player using [CBM prg Studio](https://www.ajordison.co.uk) and tested it using [C64 Forever](https://www.c64forever.com/)
